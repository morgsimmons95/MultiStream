# MultiStream
Internal Video Stream Aggregation Tool

Python-based (tkinter) GUI that intakes and stores/edits multicast video stream information that can then be played out with using Python's VLC library. Functions with UDP, RTP, and HTTP streams. Useful for storing a large amount of stream information for quick access between multicasts.

Functionality is entirely GUI for use by operations groups. Stream information is added and configured in the Manage Tab and stored in the streams.json file.
